Team MSB's problem statement: Climate change is inevitable, with projected increase in temperatures leading to phenomena such as the Urban Heat Island effect. This leads to an environment and climate where it is increasingly physically challenging for First Responders to train and operate to maximum efficiency and performance. How might SCDF leverage wearables or other technologies to provide relief or enhancement in harsh operating conditions and maximise the safety, health and performance of First Responders during training and operations?
